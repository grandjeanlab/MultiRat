# A collaborative rat functional MRI multi-center study.
A Rat fMRI multi-center study
*updated 2020_08_03*

### Executive summary
In this international collaborative project, we seek to gather the rodent imaging community toward performing a rat fMRI multi-center comparison, within the same template as Grandjean et al. NIMG 2020. We want to examine functional connectivity (FC) parameter distribution at the population level within key networks (somatosensory and default-mode network) of the rat brain, as well as establish connectivity sensitivity and specificity in the collected datasets. To do so, we will gather rat BOLD fMRI datasets from individual labs (n=10, any protocol).
In a desire to push further, we seek to obtain additional datasets pertaining to within-laboratory **test-retest** (i.e. scans that were collected in the same control animals within a period of 6 months or less), as well as datasets in **sensory-stimulation** fMRI (limb or whisker stimulation). Finally, we would like to organize a standardized data collection arm of this study for laboratories interested. This would include the **de-novo acquisition** of a dataset (n=10) using predefined, mutually-agreed, and standardized parameters consistent across all participating laboratories.
The end-goal is to make this as an available resource to researchers and to publish an extensive description of the collective dataset in a peer-reviewed journal.  

### Goal
1. To provide a large rat fMRI collective dataset
2. To describe reference population parameters distributions (e.g. FC, motion, SNR) 
3. To provide evidence-based recommendations for rat fMRI acquisition 
4. To foster collaborations and discussion within the community
5. Demonstrate test-retest reliability
6. Investigate the human-factor variability during data acquisition using a standardized protocol. 
7. Organize an international seminar on rodent data standardization at the Donders Institute (NWO Scientific Meetings and Consultations 8. Domain Science) 


### Deliverables
* OSF.io preregistered study
* Publicly available collective dataset on openneuro.org consisting of individual lab dataset
* Publicly available code to replicate the study on github.com
* Bioarxiv preprint
* Journal publication
* Symposium on rodent fMRI standards held at the Donders Institute (if funding is available)
