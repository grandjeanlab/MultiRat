# Foreword
This and the follow are R markdown files which contains all the code for reproducing my analysis and detail the process.
The code is meant to be followed step-wise. The raw fMRI dataset will not be publicly available before the project preprint publication on BioRxiv. The raw fMRI dataset can be made available prior to publication upon request and review from the authors. 

If re-using some of the scripts, please follow citations guidelines for the software used. I've provided the links to the software wherever possible. See also the [license](../LICENSE.md) for this software.  

The code is executed in `bash` (fMRI preprocessing) and `R` (analysis and plots).

See the [environement](#Environement) section for the required software libraries. The `R` libraries are organized using [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/).

To reproduce the code contained within this software, please follow these steps  
1. get the required dependencies for [bash](#Bash_environement) and [R](#R_environement)  
2. Update the variables `init_folder` and `analysis_folder` for both bash and R environments   

# Environement
The following was written in  
- [R Version: 3.5.1](https://cran.r-project.org/)  
- [rstudio Version: 1.3.959](https://rstudio.com/)  

## Bash environement
- [RABIES Version: 0.2.0-dev](https://github.com/CoBrALab/RABIES) build from  and converted into a Singularity  

Additional software include  
- FSL Version: 6.0.1  
- [Bruker2NIfTI Version: 1.0.20180303](https://github.com/neurolabusc/Bru2Nii)  
- bash binaries (curl, unzip, rm, mv, cp)  

Rstudio does not transfer variables between `bash` chunks. Hence, each chunks needs to reload the environment. To achieve this seamlessly, I use a [bash_env.sh](../bash_env.sh) file to re-initialize the environment within each chunk. The content of it should be adapted by the user for re-use. 

```{bash init bash_environement, eval=FALSE}

# Update this section to indicate where the code is kept (init_folder) and where the analysis is performed/stored (analysis_folder). 
init_folder="/home/traaffneu/joagra/code/MultiRat"
analysis_folder="/project/4180000.19/multiRat"


# no need to update the lines below. 
echo 'init_folder='$init_folder > bash_env.sh
echo 'analysis_folder='$analysis_folder >> bash_env.sh

echo 'template=$analysis_folder"/template/WHS_SD_rat_T2star_100um.nii.gz"'  >> bash_env.sh

echo 'atlas=$analysis_folder"/template/WHS_SD_rat_atlas_v3_100um.nii.gz"'  >> bash_env.sh
echo 'ROI=$analysis_folder"/template/roi/"'  >> bash_env.sh

```
