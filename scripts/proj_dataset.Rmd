In this section, I provide a brief summary of the datasets that were supplied for this study. 

Normalization steps:
- Columns with .orig have been left unaltered from how it was provided by the dataset owner. 
- Strain was simplified. 
- Age normalized to months, in 2 month bins. When long range are provided, the middle bin is selected. 
- Weight normalized to in 50 g bins. When long range are provided,  the middle bin is selected. 
- Dexmedetomidine dose converted to medetomidine (*0.5) for simplicity. 
- Injectable anesthesia dose converted to mg/kg
- Bolus injeactable added to induction column, infusions kept in maintenance column. 
- Multiple anesthesia agents for either induction or maintenance indicated with '/'. Corresponding doses follow same order. 
- Measurement post induction, breathing rate, heart rate rounded to the nearest tenth
- TR and TE converted to s
- Bandwidth converted to Hz

```{r load dataset table, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
df <- read.csv2('../assets/table/meta_data.tsv',sep='\t')
df$rat.age <- factor(df$rat.age, levels = c("0-2", "2-4", "4-6","6-8","8-10","10-12","12-14","14-16","16-18","18-20"))
```

```{r summary strain, eval=FALSE}
summary(df$rat.strain)
```

```{r summary sex, eval=FALSE}
summary(df$rat.sex)
```

```{r summary age, eval=FALSE}
#summary(df$rat.age)
ggplot(df, aes(x = rat.age, fill=rat.strain)) + geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.1)
```
