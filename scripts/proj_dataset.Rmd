In this section, I provide a brief summary of the datasets that were supplied for this study. 

Normalization steps:
- Columns with .orig have been left unaltered from how it was provided by the dataset owner. 
- Strain was simplified. 
- Age normalized to months, in 2 month bins. When long range are provided, the middle bin is selected. 
- Weight normalized to in 50 g bins. When long range are provided,  the middle bin is selected. 
- Dexmedetomidine dose converted to medetomidine (*0.5) for simplicity. 
- Injectable anesthesia dose converted to mg/kg
- Bolus injectable added to induction column, infusions kept in maintenance column. 
- Multiple anesthesia agents for either induction or maintenance indicated with '/'. Corresponding doses follow same order. 
- Measurement post induction, breathing rate, heart rate rounded to the nearest tenth
- TR and TE converted to s
- Bandwidth converted to Hz

First, I examine subject distribution

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
df <- read.csv2('../assets/table/meta_data.tsv',sep='\t')
df$rat.age <- factor(df$rat.age, levels = c("0-2", "2-4", "4-6","6-8","8-10","10-12","12-14","14-16","16-18","18-20"))
```

```{r}
summary(df$rat.strain)
```

Our collection of datasets is enriched in Wistar and Sprage Dawley rats, with Lister Hooded being least frequently used. 


```{r}
summary(df$rat.sex)
```

Consistent with the "male bias" in science, we nearly have 1:3 Female/Male ratio. 

```{r}
#summary(df$rat.age)
ggplot(df, aes(x = rat.age, fill=rat.strain)) + geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.1)+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
We tend to have younger rats, aged 0-6 months. Older rats are also available, but strain distribution is not even. 


```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = rat.weight, fill=rat.strain)) + geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.15) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
Weight distribution as a function of strain. Oddly, Fisher, despite being the oldest, are the lightest. The rats are mostly in the 300-350 range, which is consistent with my expectations. 

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(anesthesia.breathing.rate), fill=rat.strain)) + geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.15) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```



```{r}
# Selecting first rat of each dataset to get a representation of dataset parameter representations. 

df.sub <- df[df$rat.ses == 1 & sprintf('%02d', df$rat.sub %% 100) == "00", ]
summary(df.sub[,c(20,21,23,28,36,38,42,46, 47, 48, 49)])
```

Finally, I look at the dataset parameter distribution relevant for our analysis. I obtained more resting-state than stimulus-evoked dataset (3:1). Isoflurane is the most common way for induction, no surprise here. Isoflurane, medetomidine, and their combination are also the most common methods to maintain the animals in the scanner. No surprise. Free-breathing, Bruker, 7 - 9.4T fields, and GE-EPI are the norms. Again, no surprise. TR are in the 1-2 s range. 

Overall, the dataset parameter distribution is aligned with our previous observations about [fMRI in rodents](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00078/full) 


```{r}
df.na <-df[!is.na(df$anesthesia.breathing.rate) & !is.na(df$rat.strain) & !is.na(df$rat.sex) & !is.na(df$rat.age) & !is.na(df$anesthesia.maintenance),]

mod.breathing.full <- lm(anesthesia.breathing.rate ~ rat.strain + rat.sex  + rat.age + anesthesia.maintenance, df.na,na.action = na.omit)

mod.breathing.strain <- update(mod.breathing.full, . ~ . - rat.strain)
anova(mod.breathing.full,mod.breathing.strain)

mod.breathing.sex <- update(mod.breathing.full, . ~ . - rat.sex)
anova(mod.breathing.full,mod.breathing.sex)

mod.breathing.age <- update(mod.breathing.full, . ~ . - rat.age)
anova(mod.breathing.full,mod.breathing.age)


mod.breathing.maintenance <- update(mod.breathing.full, . ~ . - anesthesia.maintenance)
anova(mod.breathing.full,mod.breathing.maintenance)
```

In an exploratory analysis, I test the effects associated with breathing rates in rats. This analysis shows small effects of strain, sex, mild effect of age, and very strong effect of anesthesia used for maintenance. Both Urethane and medetomidine groups have higher breathing rates. 

```{r}
ggplot(df.na, aes(y = as.factor(anesthesia.breathing.rate), x=anesthesia.maintenance, color=rat.strain)) + geom_jitter(size = 0.15) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


```{r}
df.na <-df[!is.na(df$anesthesia.heart.rate) & !is.na(df$rat.strain) & !is.na(df$rat.sex) & !is.na(df$rat.age) & !is.na(df$anesthesia.maintenance),]

mod.heart.full <- lm(anesthesia.heart.rate ~ rat.strain + rat.sex  + rat.age + anesthesia.maintenance, df.na,na.action = na.omit)

mod.heart.strain <- update(mod.heart.full, . ~ . - rat.strain)
anova(mod.heart.full,mod.heart.strain)

mod.heart.sex <- update(mod.heart.full, . ~ . - rat.sex)
anova(mod.heart.full,mod.heart.sex)

mod.heart.age <- update(mod.heart.full, . ~ . - rat.age)
anova(mod.heart.full,mod.heart.age)


mod.heart.maintenance <- update(mod.heart.full, . ~ . - anesthesia.maintenance)
anova(mod.heart.full,mod.heart.maintenance)
```

For heart rate, fewer data points are available. We do find the expected medetomidine effect on heart rate, leading to overall lower heart rate (Bradycardia). Because not all factors are orthogonal (e.g. strain and anesthesia maintenance),  effect interpretations are rendered difficult. Similarly, effects of anesthesia dose, route, time, and induction are likely beyond our reach.  

```{r}
ggplot(df.na, aes(y = as.factor(anesthesia.heart.rate), x=anesthesia.maintenance, color=rat.strain)) + geom_jitter(size = 0.15) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
